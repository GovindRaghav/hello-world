As a child, perhaps goving through a grouchy phase, my well-meaning Mum bought me the book 'Pollyanna'.
A young orphan, Pollyana lives with her wealthy but stern Aunt Polly.In her hard life, Pllyyana's focus is on 'The Glad Game' that she had learnt from her father-of finding something to be glad aout in every situation, no matter how bleak. It originated one Christmas when Pollyanna, hoping to find a doll in the missionary barrel of crutches inside. Making the 'game' up on the spot, Pollyanna's father taught her to look at good side of things-in this case, to be glad because she didn't need to use the crutches.
